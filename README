p1 : Naive implementation of parallelism in openMP and haskell
    The tasks are really simple and therefore the single-threaded execution has an edge over multiple threads.
    The benefits of parallelism happen after >1000 tasks per thread per iteration.
    The haskell seems to do better than openMP
